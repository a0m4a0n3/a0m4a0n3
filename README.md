### 🚛 Quantum-Powered Multi-Route Optimization

**Project Summary:**  
A web-based system built to optimize delivery routes using both **classical algorithms** (Dijkstra) and **quantum computing techniques** (QAOA). The project intelligently maps and finds the most efficient delivery path across multiple destinations.

🔧 **What I Did:**

- Developed the backend using **Flask** and frontend in **JavaScript + HTML/CSS**.
- Used **Mapbox API** for interactive route visualization.
- Implemented **QAOA** using **Qiskit** to simulate quantum optimization.
- Designed a benchmarking system to compare classical and quantum performance on route planning.

📈 **Impact:**

- Achieved smarter routing in real-time without needing traffic data by using estimated time windows.
- Demonstrated how quantum algorithms can scale better for larger datasets in logistics.
- Created a solution that’s not just theoretical—it's practical, scalable, and easy to use.
